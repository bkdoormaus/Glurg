Glurg
================================================================================
Glurg extracts resources, like meshes and textures, from OpenGL call sequences.
Using certain heuristics, Glurg can also create so-called relationships between
resources to also generate things like animations.

Glurg is a weird way of saying 'OpenGL resource generator'. It probably means
other things, too.

Building
================================================================================
Currently, Glurg is in very early stages of develop. See develop branch.

Glurg's application logic is written in Lua and must be run with LuaJIT.
However, the native library, libglurg, requires building using your platform's
C++ compiler.

Glurg also depends on a patched glretrace, from apitrace.

libglurg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build libglurg, execute CMake using the provided CMakeLists.txt as usual. You
will need to provide some dependencies:

* [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
* [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
* [Sodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
* [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)
* [UbjsonCpp](https://github.com/WhiZTiM/UbjsonCpp)

glretrace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glurg requires the patch (misc/apitrace_retrace_main.patch) to be applied. The
patch works with apitrace 7.1. The custom glretrace executable should be used
with Glurg.
